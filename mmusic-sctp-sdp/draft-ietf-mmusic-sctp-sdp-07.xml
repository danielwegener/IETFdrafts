SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) is a transport protocol used to establish associations between two endpoints. This document
describes how to express media transport over SCTP in SDP (Session Description Protocol). This document defines the 'SCTP',
'SCTP/DTLS' and 'DTLS/SCTP' protocol identifiers for SDP.

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
SDP (Session Description Protocol) <xref target="RFC4566"/> provides a general-purpose format for describing multimedia sessions in
announcements or invitations. TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC4145"/> specifies 
a general mechanism for describing and establishing TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) streams. Connection-Oriented Media Transport over the Transport Layer Security
(TLS) Protocol in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC4572"/> extends RFC4145 <xref target="RFC4145"/> for
describing TCP-based media streams that are protected using TLS (Transport Layer Security) <xref target="RFC5246"/>.
</t>

<t>
This document defines three new protocol identifiers:
<list style='hanging'>
<t hangText='SCTP :'> to describe SCTP-based <xref target="RFC4960"/> media streams. </t>

<t hangText='SCTP/DTLS :'> to describe media streams transported using the Datagram Transport Layer
Security (DTLS) <xref target="RFC4347"/> protocol over SCTP, as
specified in <xref target="RFC6083"/>.
DTLS over SCTP provides communications privacy for applications that
use SCTP as their transport protocol.
</t>

<t hangText='DTLS/SCTP :'> to describe media streams transported using SCTP on top of
the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol, as
defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps"/>.
</t>

</list>
The authentication certificates are interpreted and validated as defined in RFC4572 <xref
target="RFC4572"/>. Self-signed certificates can be used securely,
provided that the integrity of the SDP description is assured as
defined in RFC4572 <xref target="RFC4572"/>.
</t>


<t>
TLS is designed to run on top of a byte-stream oriented transport
protocol providing a reliable, in-sequence delivery like TCP.  Since
no-one so far has implemented SCTP over TLS, due to some serious
limitations described in <xref target="RFC6083"/>, this document does
not make use of TLS over SCTP as described in RFC3436 <xref
target="RFC3436"/>.
</t>

<t>Additionally, this document specifies the use of the 'setup'
and 'connection' SDP attributes to establish SCTP associations. These
attributes were defined in RFC4145 <xref target="RFC4145"/> for
TCP. This document discusses their use with SCTP.</t>

<section title="Terminology">
<t>
In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described
in BCP 14, <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref> and indicate
requirement levels for compliant implementations.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Protocol Identifier" anchor="proto">
<t>
The following is the format for an 'm' line, as specified in RFC4566
<xref target="RFC4566"/>:
</t>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
    m=<media> <port> <proto> <fmt> ...
]]></artwork>
</figure>
<t>
This document defines three new values for the 'proto' field: 'SCTP',
'SCTP/DTLS' and 'DTLS/SCTP'.
</t>
<t>
The 'SCTP', 'SCTP/DTLS' and 'DTLS/SCTP' protocol identifiers are similar to both the 'UDP' and 'TCP'
protocol identifiers in that they only describe the transport protocol
and not the upper-layer protocol.</t>

<t> Media described using an 'm' line
containing the 'SCTP' protocol identifier are carried using SCTP <xref
target="RFC4960"/>.
</t>

<t>
The 'SCTP/DTLS' protocol identifier indicates that the media described
will use the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) <xref
target="RFC4347"/> over SCTP as specified in <xref target="RFC6083"/>.
</t>

<t>
The 'DTLS/SCTP' protocol identifier indicates that the media described
will use SCTP on top of the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol
as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps"/>.
The actual layer below DTLS can be plain UDP or what ICE agrees on (in the case ICE is
used to negotiate the actual transport flow).
The lower layer used is identified from the elements present inside the m= line block.
</t>


<t>
An 'm' line that specifies 'SCTP' or 'SCTP/DTLS' or 'DTLS/SCTP' MUST further qualify
the application-layer protocol using an fmt identifier.
</t>
<t>
An 'm' line that specifies 'SCTP/DTLS' or 'DTLS/SCTP' MUST provide a
certificate fingerprint only if the endpoint supports, and is willing to use, a cipher suite
with an associated certificate.  An SDP attribute (an 'a' line) is used to
transport and exchange end point certificate.  The authentication
certificates are interpreted and validated as defined in <xref target="RFC4572"/>.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Media Formats" anchor="media">
<t>
The SDP specification, <xref target="RFC4566"/>, states that specifications defining new proto values,
like the SCTP, SCTP/DTLS and DTLS/SCTP proto values defined in this RFC, must define the rules by which their
media format (fmt) namespace is managed.
Use of an existing MIME subtype for the format is encouraged. If no MIME subtype exists, it is RECOMMENDED
that a suitable one is registered through the IETF process <xref target="RFC4288"/> <xref target="RFC4289"/>
by production of, or reference to, a standards-track RFC that defines the transport protocol for the format.
</t>

<t>An m-line with &lt;proto&gt; of 'SCTP', 'SCTP/DTLS' or 'DTLS/SCTP' always describe a single SCTP association.</t>

<t>An 'm' line that specifies 'SCTP', 'SCTP/DTLS' or 'DTLS/SCTP' MUST further qualify the application-layer protocol using an 'fmt'
   identifier.</t>

<t>The 'fmtp' attribute should be used to map from the 'association-usage' (as used in an "m=" line) to the max-message-size parameter indicating
 the maximum message size, in bytes, the endpoint is willing to accept.</t>

<t>The sctp-port attribute specifies the actual sctp port.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[

]]></artwork></figure>





<section title="Media Descriptions" anchor="m-line">

<t>An 'm' line containing the 'SCTP', 'SCTP/DTLS' or 'DTLS/SCTP' protocol identifier has the following syntax:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[

    sctp-m-line = %x6d "="
     ("application" space sctp-port space "SCTP"	space sctp-fmt CRLF) /

    sctp-port = port

    udp-port = port

    sctp-fmt = association-usage 

    association-usage = token

]]></artwork></figure>


<t>The media description change slightly depending on the actual &lt;proto&gt;.</t>
<t><list style='hanging'>
<t>If the &lt;proto&gt; sub-field is 'SCTP' or 'SCTP/DTLS', the &lt;port&gt; is the SCTP transport port (sctp-port) and follows the same active/passive offer/answer model described in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC4145"/>.</t>

<t>If the &lt;proto&gt; sub-field is 'DTLS/SCTP', the &lt;port&gt; is the UDP transport port (udp-port).</t>
</list></t>

<t>The &lt;fmt&gt; sub-field carries the parameter indicating the conventional usage of an entire sctp association (association-usage).</t>
<t><list style='hanging'>

<t hangText="association-usage:">
 <vspace />The association-usage token indicates the conventional usage of an entire sctp association including its streams (e.g. the pairing of certain streams, the protocol carried over certain streams, etc). This parameter is a required parameter. [TBD a value for the generic usage as defined in RFC 4960 <xref target="RFC4960"/>].</t>
</list></t>

<t>Any offered association MAY be rejected in the answer, for any reason.  If an association offer is rejected,
the offerer and answerer MUST NOT establish an SCTP association for it.  To reject an SCTP association, the &lt;port&gt;

<t>The sctp-port attribute specifies the actual sctp port. This attribute is optional and is only meaningful and required if the the &lt;proto&gt; sub-field is 'DTLS/SCTP'.
If the attribute is not present, the default value is 5000.</t>

</section>

<t>The 'fmtp' attribute may be used to map from the 'association-usage' (as used in an "m=" line) to the max-message-size parameter indicating
 the maximum message size, in bytes, the endpoint is willing to accept.</t>



<t>The max-message-size parameter indicates the maximum message size, in bytes, the endpoint is willing to accept.
The peer should assume that larger message will be rejected by the endpoint, though it is up to the endpoint decide the appropriate behaviour.
A parameter with value of '0' will signal a best effort attempt, subject to the current endpoint memory capacity, to handle messages of any size.
If the parameter is not present, the implementation should provide a default, with a suggested value of 64K.
</t>

<section title="The Setup and Connection Attributes and Association
		Management"
anchor="sec-attributes">
<t>
The use of the 'setup' and 'connection' attributes in the context of
an SCTP association is identical to the use of these attributes in the
context of a TCP connection. That is, SCTP endpoints MUST follow the
rules in Sections 4 and 5 of RFC 4145 <xref target="RFC4145"/> when it
comes to the use of the 'setup' and 'connection' attributes in
offer/answer <xref target="RFC3264"/> exchanges.
</t>
<t>
The management of an SCTP association is identical to the management
of a TCP connection. That is, SCTP endpoints MUST follow the rules in
Section 6 of RFC 4145 <xref target="RFC4145"/> to manage SCTP
associations. Whether to use the SCTP ordered or unordered delivery
service is up to the applications using the SCTP association.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Multihoming">
<t>
An SCTP endpoint, unlike a TCP endpoint, can be multihomed. An SCTP
endpoint is considered to be multihomed if it has more than one IP
address. A multihomed SCTP endpoint informs a remote SCTP endpoint
about all its IP addresses using the address parameters of the INIT or
the INIT-ACK chunk (depending on whether the multihomed endpoint is
the one initiating the establishment of the association). Therefore,
once the address provided in the 'c' line has been used to establish
the SCTP association (i.e., to send the INIT chunk), address
management is performed using SCTP. This means that two SCTP endpoints
can use addresses that were not listed in the 'c' line but that were
negotiated using SCTP mechanisms.
</t>
<t>
During the lifetime of an SCTP association, the endpoints can add and
remove new addresses from the association at any point <xref
target="RFC5061"/>. If an endpoint removes the IP address listed in
its 'c' line from the SCTP association, the endpoint SHOULD update the
'c' line (e.g., by sending a re-INVITE with a new offer) so that it
contains an IP address that is valid within the SCTP association.
</t>
<t>
In some environments, intermediaries performing firewall control use
the addresses in offer/answer exchanges to perform media
authorization. That is, policy-enforcement network elements do not
let media through unless it is sent to the address in the 'c'
line.
</t>
<t>
In such network environments, the SCTP endpoints can only exchange
media using the IP addresses listed in their 'c' lines. In these
environments, an endpoint wishing to use a different address needs to
update its 'c' line (e.g., by sending a re-INVITE with a new offer) so
that it contains the new IP address.
</t>

<t>It is worth to underline that when using SCTP on top of DTLS,
only single homed SCTP associations can be used, since DTLS does
not expose any address management to its upper layer.</t>
</section>


<section title="Network Address Translation (NAT) Considerations">
<t>
SCTP specific features (not present in UDP/TCP), such as the checksum
(CRC32c) value calculated on the whole packet (not just the header) or
its multihoming capabilities, present new challenges for NAT
traversal. <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-sctpnat"/> describes an SCTP
specific variant of NAT, which provides similar features of Network
Address and Port Translation (NAPT).
</t>
<t>
Current NATs do not typically support SCTP. As an alternative to
design SCTP specific NATs, Encapsulating SCTP into UDP <xref target="RFC6951"/>
makes it possible to use SCTP in networks with legacy NAT and firewalls not supporting SCTP.
</t>
<t>
At the time of writing, the work on NAT traversal for SCTP is still
work in progress. Additionally, no extension has been defined to
integrate ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) <xref
target="RFC5768"/> with SCTP and its multihoming capabilities
either. Therefore, this specification does not define how to establish and maintain SCTP
associations using ICE. Should this feature be specified for SCTP in
the future, there will be a need to specify how to use them in an SDP
environment as well.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Examples">
<t>
The following examples show the use of the 'setup' and 'connection'
SDP attributes. As discussed in <xref target="sec-attributes"/>, the
use of these attributes with an SCTP association is identical to their
use with a TCP connection. For the purpose of brevity, the main
portion of the session description is omitted in the examples, which
only show 'm' lines and their attributes (including 'c' lines).
</t>

<section title="Actpass/Passive" anchor="actpass-pass">
<t>
An offerer at 192.0.2.2 signals its availability for an SCTP
association at SCTP port 54111. Additionally, this offerer is also
willing to initiate the SCTP association:
</t>
<figure anchor="exemple1.1" title="">

	   m=application 54111 SCTP t38

<t>
The endpoint at 192.0.2.1 responds with the following description:
</t>
<figure anchor="exemple1.2" title="">

<t>
This will cause the offerer (at 192.0.2.2) to initiate an SCTP
association to port 54321 at 192.0.2.1.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Existing Connection Reuse" anchor="sec-reuse">
<t>
Subsequent to the exchange in <xref target="actpass-pass"/>, another
offer/answer exchange is initiated in the opposite direction.  The
endpoint at 192.0.2.1, which now acts as the offerer, wishes to
continue using the existing association:
